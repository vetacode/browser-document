<!-- To get window width and height, we can use the clientWidth/clientHeight of document.documentElement
 It returns the width/height of the VISIBLE PART of the document, available for the content, NOT include scrollbar width & height
NOTES: window.innerWidth/innerHeight includes the scrollbar.

THEREFORE:
alert( window.innerWidth ); // full window width
alert( document.documentElement.clientWidth ); // window width minus the scrollbar


DOCTYPE is important
Top-level geometry properties may work a little bit differently when there’s no <!DOCTYPE HTML> in HTML. Odd things are possible.

In modern HTML we MUST always write DOCTYPE.
