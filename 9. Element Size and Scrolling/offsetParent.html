          Introduction This Ecma Standard is based on several originating
          technologies, the most well known being JavaScript (Netscape) and
          JScript (Microsoft). The language was invented by Brendan Eich at
          Netscape and first appeared in that company’s Navigator 2.0 browser.
          It has appeared in all subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all
          browsers from Microsoft
        </div>
      </article>
    </main>
    <script>
      console.log(example.offsetParent.id); // main
      console.log(example.offsetLeft); // 180 (note: a number, not a string "180px")
      console.log(example.offsetTop); // 180 (number)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- NOTES:
There are several occasions when offsetParent is null:

For not shown elements (display:none or not in the document).
For <body> and <html>.
For elements with position:fixed. -->
