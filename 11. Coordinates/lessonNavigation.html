<!-- Most JavaScript methods deal with one of two coordinate systems:

1. Relative to the window = position:fixed, calculated from the window top/left edge.
we’ll denote these coordinates as clientX/clientY

2. Relative to the document = position:absolute in the document root, calculated from the document top/left edge.
we’ll denote them pageX/pageY. -->
