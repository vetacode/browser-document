<!-- NOTES:

elem/[ID_value].setAttribute('attr_name', 'attr_value')

1. getAttribute('About') – the first letter is uppercase here, and in HTML it’s all lowercase. But that doesn’t matter: attribute names are NOT case-sensitive.
2. We can assign anything to an attribute, but it becomes a string. So here we have "123" as the value.
3. All attributes including ones that we set are visible in outerHTML.
4. The attributes collection is iterable and has all the attributes of the element (standard and non-standard) as objects with name and value properties. -->
